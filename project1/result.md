### 15. In the given database the Borders relation is symmetric: if the country 1 (c1) borders country 2 (c2), country 2 also borders country 1. One may wish to check this property on a given database. Write a query that determines all tuples {c1, c2}, where c1 and c2 are the codes of the countries, for which the inverse direction is missing. (Note: on the given database, the output of this query should be empty; on a database in which the Border relation is not symmetric, however, it should return the violating tuples. Create a database yourself to check this.)

SQL:

```sql
SELECT country1,country2
FROM Borders
WHERE (country2,country1) NOT IN (
    SELECT country1,country2
    FROM Borders
)
