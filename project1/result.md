### 13. List the name of all countries which have zero Covid cases until 12/2021 (included) together with their neighboring countries. The result must be a relation composed of tuples of 2 attributes {country1, country2} where the country1 is the zero-Covid country and country2 is its neighboring country. If a country has no neighboring country, it should not be included in the output.

SQL:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name as country1,c.name as country2
FROM (
    SELECT code, name
    FROM Country
    WHERE code NOT IN
    (SELECT DISTINCT country
    FROM CountryCovid
    WHERE total_cases>0 AND year<2022)

LEFT JOIN Country as c ON b.country2=c.code
WHERE c.name IS NOT NULL
```

Rel:

```rel

---

### 14. List the most prominent language(s) for each country; i.e., list for each country those languages for which the percentage is maximal. You are not allowed to use SUMMARIZE. The result must be a relation composed of 2-tuples with attributes {country, name}, where country is the code of the country and name is the name of the language.

SQL:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.country  as country, a.name as name
FROM Language a
LEFT OUTER JOIN Language b
    ON a.country = b.country AND a.percentage < b.percentage
WHERE b.country IS NULL;
```

Rel:

```rel

```

---

### 15. In the given database the Borders relation is symmetric: if the country 1 (c1) borders country 2 (c2), country 2 also borders country 1. One may wish to check this property on a given database. Write a query that determines all tuples {c1, c2}, where c1 and c2 are the codes of the countries, for which the inverse direction is missing. (Note: on the given database, the output of this query should be empty; on a database in which the Border relation is not symmetric, however, it should return the violating tuples. Create a database yourself to check this.)

SQL:

```sql

```

Rel:

```rel

```

---

### 16. Some countries have incomplete information about their dialects and languages. List the name of countries for which the total percentage of reported languages does not reach 99% together with the proportion of the population for which this information is unknown. The result should have the form {name, unknown_lang_p}.

SQL:

```sql

```

Rel:

```rel
